# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday 09 March 2023

**Today's Intentions**: Start working on my Python skills to eventually become confident in Python.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
